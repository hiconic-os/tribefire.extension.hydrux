/**
 * This is an abstract supertype for an {@link HxView} that serves a very special purpose - evaluating a service request by asking a user for input
 * (in a form of a dialog window).
 * 
 * <h3>Simple example</h3>
 * 
 * Imagine we have a service request called FormatText, with a property "text" of type String. Typically, this would be evaluated on a server, where a
 * processor is registered which modifies the text, e.g. toUpperCase.
 * <p>
 * That's fine, but static. What if we wanted to ask the user what kind of effect we want to apply, e.g. toUpperCase, toLowerCase or say lIkE tHiS?
 * <p>
 * For this purpose we can create a view ({@code FormatTextDialog extends HxRequestDialog}) that shows three buttons for these three options plus a
 * "Cancel" button.
 * <p>
 * We then bind a special service-processor for our FormatText request like this: {@code bindDialogProcessor(FormatText.T, formatTextDialogInstance)}
 * <p>
 * Note this bind method is available in hydrux api on {@code IHxModuleBindingContext.serviceProcessorBinder}.
 * <p>
 * This bind method creates a special service-processor internally which
