 * Hydrux is a TypeScript based framework for writing modular client (UX) applications based on tribefire.js.
 * <p>
 * Hydrux client is configured by meta-data on an access data-model or a service domain. The top-level application is defined by
 * {@link HxApplication}, and components for handling individual entity types are defined using {@link HxViewWith}.
